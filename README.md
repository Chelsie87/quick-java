# quick-java

I had never worked with Java prior to these assignments. 
Although these are fairly rudimentary, I learned a bit of Java and created these programs within the same week and got 100s on all of them.

Recursion1:
//Question 1.
		//1. Write a recursive function that will return the number of vowels in a string. 
		//You will ask the user to enter the string.
		//a e i o u A E I O U
		//Y is a special case, and I will leave a note instead of including it as a vowel
    
Recursion2:
//Question 2:	
		//Write a recursive function that receives an integer as a parameter and returns the numbers reversed.  
		//Ask the user to enter the number.
    
Recursion3:
//3. Write recursive function that receives 2 integer parameters 
		//and returns the first parameter raised to the power of the 2nd parameter.  
		//Ask the user to enter 2 integers greater than 0.

Pizza Ordering Program:
Write a Java program that will simulate a pizza shop receiving an order. The caller will give the size they want and a list of toppings.  Create a pizza class that will store the size, toppings, and price.  Include a constructor that requires arguments for size and toppings. Include a method to display the pizza order and total price.  The price for a 12 inch pizza is $10.99, a 14 inch pizza is $14.99 and a 16 inch pizza is $18.99.  Create a subclass named DeliveryPizza that inherits from pizza but adds an address as an argument to the constructor.    The delivery fee is $5.00.  Write an application program that will ask the user for the size and toppings. Then ask them if they pizza is for pick-up or delivery.  If the order is for delivery, ask the user the address. Then, display the pizza order on the screen.


This last one is broken into three seperate files so I made a new branch containing them. They are all contained in a package called demopizza.
