# quick-java

I had never worked with Java prior to these assignments. 

Recursion1:
//Question 1.
		//1. Write a recursive function that will return the number of vowels in a string. 
		//You will ask the user to enter the string.
		//a e i o u A E I O U
		//Y is a special case, and I will leave a note instead of including it as a vowel
    
Recursion2:
//Question 2:	
		//Write a recursive function that receives an integer as a parameter and returns the numbers reversed.  
		//Ask the user to enter the number.
    
Recursion3:
//3. Write recursive function that receives 2 integer parameters 
		//and returns the first parameter raised to the power of the 2nd parameter.  
		//Ask the user to enter 2 integers greater than 0.
